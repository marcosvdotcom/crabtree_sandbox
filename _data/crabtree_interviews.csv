And this collection, I think, is a great example of that, where yes, it caused harm, but now we're looking at, um, let's acknowledge those appropriations. Let's acknowledge the ways that this collection could have been done better…",,MacLeod-L_TrimmedVideo_2022-11-29.mp4,MacLeod-L_TrimmedAudio_2022-11-29.m4a,MacLeod-L_InterviewTranscript_2022-11-29.txt,interview,https://youtu.be/M3HOHb2zVjk,/objects/MacLeod-L_InterviewTranscript_2022-11-29.txt,lorisia-macleod.jpg

Prior to that, Meyers was the Director of Graduate Studies and associate professor at Oglala Lakota College on the Pine Ridge Reservation.",,Interview with Richard Meyers,,,,"You see power dynamics through the lens of sociolinguistics. And circling that all back to your question, how something is framed, 'arrowheads of these people,' the terminal narratives of archaeology, the Anasazi, 'the people who are no longer able to make decisions about artifacts' is detaching the contemporary people who are those direct descendants. But if you make a terminal narrative, no one knows who left this. [laughs] Well, I'm not so sure that's, you know. There, there are difficulties, don't get me wrong, and Tribally-specific, but not culturally in the large sense of — of regionality and, and people. So again, it brings and always invokes multiple layers to keep peeling back as to where do you want to stop thinking about this phenomena? And then ultimately who has ownership [laughs] of what has become a commodity?",,Meyers-R_TrimmedVideo_2022-12-05.mp4,Meyers-R_TrimmedAudio_2022-12-05.m4a,Meyers-R_InterviewTranscript_2022-12-05.txt,interview,https://youtu.be/uvgugxXroy0,/objects/Meyers-R_InterviewTranscript_2022-12-05.txt,

You — you acknowledge where you've learned things, you acknowledge your teachers and your mentors, and, and then that gives them voice in, in who they are, you know, so it's not just a, ""hey, this is just me. I made this. Aren't I a great basket maker?,"" right.

Newsom is also affiliated with the University of Maine's Climate Change Institute and is a mother of four and grandmother of three.,,Interview with Bonnie Newsom,,,,"Well, I think — I think people need to recognize, and they probably will through this collection, but I — I think people need to recognize that it's a very sophisticated skill that people had, uh, that was crucial for people being able to survive. And, um, you know, folks had to have a sense of, um, physics, geology, geometry.","Well, first of all, I think I use experimental archaeology all the time with my students because I think it — it gives them a deeper appreciation and understanding of the material culture that they're working with. And, um, the — the kind of, uh, negative side of that is, you know again, we go back to people using experimental archaeology to understand Indigenous lifeways or Indigenous technologies, but not giving any of that information back. Um it's self-serving, um, or can be, it's not always, of course, but it can be self-serving. And, and I think we need to shift that mindset away from, um, uh, you know I'm doing this for myself 'cause it's really cool and I want to learn how to flintknap to, um, I'm doing this because this technology or this skill was, um, uh, taken from Indigenous peoples, and I wanna — I wanna experiment with that so I can, um, give that back, in some way.",Newsom-B_TrimmedVideo-3_2022-12-12.mp4,Newsom-B_TrimmedAudio-3_2022-12-12.m4a,Newsom-B_InterviewTranscript-3_2022-12-12.txt,interview,https://youtu.be/_9CgvUJ9BsE,/objects/Newsom-B_InterviewTranscript-3_2022-12-12.txt,

And whether that be a lithic collection, whether that be ethnographic collections, whether that be photographs, I mean there's archives, there's so many elements to this, all of it needs interrogating because it's all a record of a particular uh, sort of, intellectual tradition which has done itself, and continues to do, a lot of harm.","One of the things I would want people to understand about flintknapping is that it's not a primitive way of being, and I think there's a lot of interconnection, problematic interconnection with like, ""primitive,"" quote, unquote…And so I think for me, recognizing that — that flintknapping um you know, is complex. It's not simply just hittin' some flakes off a stone. It requires a deep understanding and knowledge of not just the stone itself, but where the stone itself comes from, sort of the context and how it gets to the person who actually creates its final shape.",Supernant-K_TrimmedVideo_2022-11-17.mp4,Supernant-K_TrimmedAudio_2022-11-17.m4a,Supernant-K_InterviewTranscript_2022-11-17.txt,interview,https://youtu.be/r1JnXNvQCYk,/objects/Supernant-K_InterviewTranscript_2022-11-17.txt,kisha-supernant.jpg

Younker is also Chief of the Coquille Indian Tribe and an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Oregon.,,Interview with Jason Younker,,,,"Understand as much as you can about where it came from because not only are you replicating something, but you're also learning from what the past has to teach you. So I have no problem with people replicating. I have a problem with people appropriating and saying that they are the experts when really they are replicating thousands of years of technology. And that's what I would — that's what I would encourage archaeol- or flintknappers to think about is, uh, these are things that are easily replicated, but the knowledge, to learn the knowledge is even more fun.",,Younker-J_TrimmedVideo_2022-10-19.mp4,Younker-J_TrimmedAudio_2022-10-19.m4a,Younker-J_InterviewTranscript_2022-10-19.txt,interview,https://youtu.be/wuw0IzQTE54,/objects/Younker-J_InterviewTranscript_2022-10-19.txt,
