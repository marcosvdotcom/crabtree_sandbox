Source code for digital collection project providing access to the Donald E. Crabtree Lithic Technology Collection, from the Alfred W. Bowers Laboratory of Anthropology, University of Idaho.
The collection is a unique representation of Donald Crabtree’s lifelong work with lithic technology, demonstrating Crabtree’s creativity and innovation in flintknapping as well as reflecting the knowledge and practices of Native and Indigenous people from around the world.

Digitization was supported by a Digitizing Hidden Collections grant from the [Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR)](https://www.clir.org/) as a collaborative effort between the [University of Idaho Library](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/) and [Alfred W. Bowers Laboratory of Anthropology (AWBLA/Bowers Lab)](https://www.uidaho.edu/class/anthrolab).

The website was developed by [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu) at the University of Idaho Library, based on a customized version of the [CollectionBuilder-CSV template](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-csv).
